We have 3 options to connect our Arduino to API to monitor our data from the Arduino which will be our data provider from the different equipments we are using in our project . To get the data from our Arduino we can use one of the following 3 options: Arduino IOT cloud , Blynk and Making our own website.


Pushing Box:
For our minor project we are going to use the pushing box to monitor the data about the child and print the status on a line graph or a pie chart and we can get the sum and average of the values we are getting.

Blynk  & Arduino IOT cloud:
Which are two powerful services that allow anyone to create IoT applications, they were designed for the internet of things . they can control hardware remotely ,they can display sensor data, they can store data, visualize it and do many other cool things .
Negative points:
 We only have 100 notifications which most of them will be wasted in the prototyping process then we will have to wait till next day or  pay for more notifications.



Making our own website :
We can make our own website to control the Arduino and get the data from the Arduino to the website using HTML ,CSS and C++, by making variables in C++ and add them in the HTML code .We can adjust the look of our website the way we want and
